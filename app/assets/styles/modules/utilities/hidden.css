/* 

When an element has a hidden attribute, they should be hidden
from view. Normalize.css does this for us already.

The problem with this style is its low specificity.

I often add hidden to other elements I style with a
class. A class’s specificity is high than an attribute
, and the display: none property doesn’t work.

This is why I opt to bump up [hidden]'s 
specificity with !important.

[hidden] {
  display: none !important;
